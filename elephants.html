<h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
<p> Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: 
    the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. 
    They are an informal grouping within the proboscidean family Elephantidae. 
    Gestation period: Asian elephant: 18 – 22 months, African bush elephant: 22 months
    Mass: Asian elephant: 4 000 kg, African bush elephant: 6 000 kg, African forest elephant: 2 700 – 6 000 kg
    Lifespan: Asian elephant: 48 years, African bush elephant: 60 – 70 years, African forest elephant: 60 – 70 years
    Height: Asian elephant: 2,8 m, African bush elephant: 3,2 m </p>

<p> Elephants are some of the most intelligent animals on Earth. Their brains weigh 11 lbs. (5 kg.), much more than the brain of any other land animal. 
    Their brains have more complex folds than all animals except whales, which is thought to be a major factor in their intellect.
    They commonly show grief, humor, compassion, cooperation, self-awareness, tool-use, playfulness, and excellent learning abilities. 
    An elephant in Korea surprised its zoo keepers by independently learning to mimic the commands they gave it by verbalizing with the end of its trunk, 
    successfully learning 8 words and their context. </p>
