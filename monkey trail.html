<h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
<p> The second most well-known hiking trail in Cape Town (after Lionâ€™s Head), Platteklip is not so easygoing, despite its popularity. It provides a direct route to the summit of Table Mountain, 
    for those who think taking the cable car is for lightweights.</p>

<p>Beginning point: Tafelberg Road
    Ending point: Upper Cableway Station
    Estimated time: 3 hours
    Need to know: Platteklip is best avoided on a hot day, as there is little shade to be found along the trail. If you plan to take the cable car down, make note of operational times and ensure you reach the station before the last cable car leaves.
    Important note: SANParks has informed us that many rescues are performed at this site, as people underestimate the heat and the level of fitness required, or they miss the last cable car and end up stranded on the mountain at night. Please take the necessary precautions.
    Child-friendly: Yes, although take note of the above.
    Dog-friendly: Bringing dogs is not recommended on this trail, they may struggle in the heat.
    Location: Table Mountain National Park </p>
