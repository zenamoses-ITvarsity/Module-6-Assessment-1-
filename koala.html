<h3>KOALA</h3>
<p> Description. Koalas are well-known for their large round head, big furry ears and big black nose. 
Their fur is usually grey-brown in colour with white fur on the chest, inner arms, ears and bottom. ... 
They have an acute sense of smell which also helps them detect other koalas and their favourite food trees.
The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae
 and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which are members of the family Vombatidae. </p>

<p>Sadly, koala numbers are on the decline. Their numbers have been falling further and further every year due to deforestation and disease. 
Then, Australia was ravaged by the most devastating, unprecedented bushfire season the country has ever seen. 
Tragically, nearly 3 billion animals, many found nowhere else in the world, perished.  Many struggling Australian species, like our koalas, have now been pushed even further towards the brink of extinction. 
The good news is that there is hope to turn this around.</p>
