<h3>GORILLA</h3>
<p>Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. 
The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies.The largest of the great apes, gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and shoulders,
large, human-like hands, and small eyes set into hairless faces. The two gorilla species live in equatorial Africa, separated by about 560 miles of Congo Basin forest. 
Each has a lowland and upland subspecies.</p>

<p>Gorillas move around by knuckle-walking, although they sometimes walk upright for short distances, typically while carrying food or in defensive situations. 
A 2018 study investigating the hand posture of 77 mountain gorillas at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (8% of the population) found that knuckle walking was done only 60% of the time, 
and they also supported their weight on their fists, the backs of their hands/feet, and on their palms/soles (with the digits flexed). 
Such a range of hand postures was previously thought to have been used by only orangutans.Studies have shown gorilla blood is not reactive to anti-A and anti-B monoclonal antibodies, which would, 
in humans, indicate type O blood. Due to novel sequences, though, it is different enough to not conform with the human ABO blood group system, into which the other great apes fit.</p>
